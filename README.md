# logsmith-monitor

A stand-alone logging Server for  multi-component apps. Move logging out of your apps and let logsmith-monitor handle and store them for you.

Logsmith-Monitor lets you detache your Apps and Logs to give a hassle free logging experience. Different running components of your app that publish logs can push them into a central logging server - logsmith-monitor, making monitoring across components easier.
