# Notes

## Types of Supported Loggings

Plan is to support 

- message-logs (general purpose/message based logs) | maybe called unstructured logs - doesnt have schema - has message and status - can have random keys to log
- tech-logs (JSON Objects with details that need to be logged) | maybe called structured logs - has schema - has message and status - only schema-matched logs are logged 
- metrics (time taken/space used/etc) | json object of performance and stats
- what else?
